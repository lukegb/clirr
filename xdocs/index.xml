Clirr is a tool that checks Java libraries for binary compatibility
with older releases. Basically you give it two
sets of jar files and Clirr dumps out a list of changes in the public api.
The Clirr Ant task can be configured to break the build if it detects
incompatible api changes. In a continuous integration process Clirr can
automatically prevent accidental introduction of binary compatibility
problems.

        The name clirr is derived from the binary compatibility property
        that a new release of a library/component should have (cited from
        the above mentioned Eclipse article):
            </p>
            <p>
        Pre-existing
                <em>C</em>lient binaries must
                <em>li</em>nk and
                <em>r</em>un with new
                <em>r</em>eleases of the Component without recompiling.
            </p>
            <p>
        You can also use clirr as a verb, as in
                <cite>Last night the build clirred</cite>,
        meaning that binary incompatibility problems were detected and broke the build.
